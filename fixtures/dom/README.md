# DOM Fixtures

A set of DOM test cases for quickly identifying browser issues.

## Setup

To reference a local build of React, first run `yarn build` at the root
of the React project. Then:

```
cd fixtures/dom
yarn
yarn start
```

The `start` command runs a script that copies over the local build of react into
the public directory.
