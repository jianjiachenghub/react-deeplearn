      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

  <h1>Expiration Example</h1>
  <p>This fixture demonstrates expiration using the
    <code>timeout</code> option of
    <code>requestIdleCallback</code>. If it's working correctly, you should see below a number that increments approximately once every second (the expiration
    time of a low priority update.) If there is no counter, or if it increases too slowly or quickly, something is broken.
