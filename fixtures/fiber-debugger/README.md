# Fiber Debugger

This is a debugger handy for visualizing how [Fiber](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6170) works internally.

**It is only meant to be used by React contributors, and not by React users.**

It is likely that it might get broken at some point. If it's broken, ping [Dan](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov).

### Running

First, `npm run build` in React root repo folder.

Then `npm install` and `npm start` in this folder.

Open `http://localhost:3000` in Chrome.

### Features

* Edit code that uses `ReactNoop` renderer
* Visualize how relationships between fibers change over time
* Current tree is displayed in green
